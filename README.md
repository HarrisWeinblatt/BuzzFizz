# FizzBuzz Java function
FizzBuzz is a program created using Java that is essentially a counter up to 100 by 1 using a for loop and then using if and if else statements to manipulate the output when printed instead of just printing 1-100. For example. The output will count from 1 to 100 but print 'Fizz' when the numbers are divided by 3 and print 'Buzz' when divisible by 5, and finally print 'FizzBuzz' when the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
